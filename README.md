# C++ Demos

A collection of c++ demo scripts built up from learning/testing different features and techniques of the language.
Quite disjoined as a result, but should be easy to add too.

## Usage

Run
```
make
```
in the main directory to compile all the scripts in their individual directories.

Alternatively, run
```
make
```
in the individual directories to compile just a single demo.

Similarly,
```
make clean
```
removes the compiled libraries and programs.
